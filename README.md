# Computer-Security-Project
The project aims to create a user-friendly Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter to perform cryptographic operations such as:

1. **DES encryption.**
2. **SHA-1 Hashing.**
3. **Digital Signature Standard (DSS).** 

This application will provide a convenient platform for users to encrypt and decrypt data using the Data Encryption Standard (DES), generate hash values using the SHA-1 algorithm, and sign/verify messages using the Digital Signature Standard.
